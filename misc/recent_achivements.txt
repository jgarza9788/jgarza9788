2024 Enterprise goal: Diversity & Inclusion (What): Justin has worked to be a good collaborator with his teammates and a mentor to new members.  He works to be very accommodating to help where he can, and the team leads look for his feedback for planning/resource management. His collaborative approach with a wide variety of team members helps maintain a positive environment for everyone to have a say. 2024 Enterprise goal: Manage Risk (What): Justin is becoming more of a leader in testing and is getting included in more risk conversations. Managing ARP was a learning experience where he saw the type of work that needs to be done to pass mandatory reviews. He is also helping analyze transactions to data to try and improve our reporting and calculations. With that data we will be able to make better decisions on transaction processing.to improve performance and reduce risks. 2024 Enterprise goal: Operational Excellence (What): Justin's work on managing testing for the application is a role he continues to grow into.  He has been helping the team by setting a higher standard, enforcing quality (through his Radical work of Checks and Backouts) He is also looking at what new tools we can integrate into our processes and contribute to AGILE planning. Teach others on Radical: He tries to encourage best practices and we have discussed how we can try to get other team members onboard with documentation standard adoption. 2024 Enterprise goal: Great Place to Work (How): Justin works to be a good mentor to the team. Dylan and Uday have benefitted from his guidance and the offshore team takes his guidance daily. He works to try and expand the knowledge of the team through documentation and encourages best practices. Be an Advocate of the Doherty Threshold: While I am aware Justin is self-training on OpenShift, we may need to review further the progress he is making to this goal. He is a strong proponent of trying to improve efficiency in his workspace and is promoting his ideas to the rest of the team. Speak up about AC's more: It would be great to get more feedback on this, this is becoming a larger scope issue that is he concerned causes more delays in our working processes. Overall: Justin continues his efforts supporting GTMS and trying to build out improved processes.  He is particularly supportive of new team members who praise his guidance. He brings innovative ideas that are valuable to trying to improve how we are currently doing our work. I think this will be especially valuable as he begins to learn more risk related work, support audit capabilities and help the team manage reviews.
